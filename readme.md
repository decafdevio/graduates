# Graduates Recruitment App

Graduates is a portal for graduates and employers to connect. Each role can define obtained or required skills which filter through search or are displayed in a brief card window on the dashboard. All users have designated CRUD permissions for editing profile content including display images and documents.

Graduates recruitment app was created as part of a pair-programming exercise following agile project management methods with Jira and Slack for communication. It was built with React framework and a Node, Express backend with MongoDB (MERN stack). The original layout used rows of 3 column cards designed to display only the most necessary user information.
